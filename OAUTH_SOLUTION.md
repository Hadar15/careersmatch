# OAuth Redirect Issue - Comprehensive Solution

## Current Situation ✅
- Authentication is working (users are created in Supabase)
- OAuth flow completes successfully
- Issue: Redirect goes to localhost instead of production callback

## Root Cause 🔍
The localhost redirect is likely caused by:
1. **Google OAuth Client Configuration** - May have localhost in authorized redirect URIs
2. **Cached OAuth Settings** - Browser or Supabase caching old configurations
3. **Supabase OAuth Provider Settings** - May need refresh

## Solutions Implemented 🚀

### 1. Enhanced OAuth Configuration
- Added explicit redirectTo parameter with production URL
- Added queryParams for better OAuth handling
- Simplified loading state management

### 2. Enhanced Main Page Handler
- Improved code exchange logic
- Added error handling for OAuth errors
- Redirect to dashboard after successful authentication

### 3. Fallback Strategy
Since your main page already handles OAuth codes, even if users get redirected to localhost, they can:
1. Manually navigate to your production site
2. The code will still be valid and get processed
3. They'll be logged in automatically

## Next Steps 📋

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Deploy these changes**
2. **Test on production site** (`https://careersmatchai.vercel.app`)
3. **Check Google Cloud Console**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - APIs & Services > Credentials
   - Find your OAuth client
   - Check "Authorized redirect URIs"
   - Should include: `https://[your-supabase-project].supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
   - Remove any localhost entries

### Verification Steps:
1. Click Google login on production
2. If redirected to localhost, manually change URL to production
3. Check if you're logged in (user should be authenticated)
4. If this works, the issue is definitely in Google OAuth client settings

### Ultimate Fix:
Update Google OAuth client authorized redirect URIs to only include production URLs.

## Expected Outcome 🎯
After Google OAuth client fix:
- Users click Google login
- Authenticate with Google
- Get redirected to production callback
- Automatically logged in and redirected to dashboard

The authentication mechanism is working perfectly - it's just a redirect URL configuration issue!
